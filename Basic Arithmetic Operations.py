# This program performs basic arithmetic operations on variables
# Assign values to variables
num1 = 10
num2 = 5
# Perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
sum = num1 + num2
difference = num1 - num2
product = num1 * num2
quotient = num1 / num2
# Print the results
print("Sum:", sum)
print("Difference:", difference)
print("Product:", product)
print("Quotient:", quotient)
